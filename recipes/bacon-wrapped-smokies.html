        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            Bacon-wrapped smokies are a popular appetizer or snack made by wrapping small, 
            cocktail-sized sausages (known as smokies) with strips of bacon and then cooking them until the bacon is crispy and the smokies are heated through. 
            Often, they are seasoned with a variety of ingredients such as brown sugar, barbecue sauce, or honey to add extra flavor.
